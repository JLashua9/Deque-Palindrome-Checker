# Python Deque Implementation with Palindrome Checker

A Python implementation of a double-ended queue (deque) data structure with a practical application for checking palindromes. The deque allows for efficient addition and removal of elements from both ends, making it ideal for palindrome verification.

## Features
- Complete deque implementation with add/remove operations for both ends
- Utility methods for checking emptiness, size, and peeking at elements
- Palindrome checker function using the deque data structure
- Well-documented with docstrings following standard conventions

This repository demonstrates fundamental data structure concepts and their practical applications in algorithmic problem-solving.
